# Prologue

What Others Are Saying About Voyagers I…
“The X Files is nothing compared to this book. It fell into my
lap at the perfect moment, when I was discovering a subconscious part
of me that had experienced alien abductions since a young child. Up
until the year 2000 I had denied such things were possible.
“Now my life, especially my nights, were filled with a
penetrating fear, not knowing if tonight would involve another
unwelcome visit.
“This book brought back the light into these night terrors, where
I now understand the mystery and know how to deal with frequency
fences (illusions of reality) that are projected into my mind.
“If you believe/know you are part of this mysterious adventure,
this is the survival book to claim back your power and face your fears!”
